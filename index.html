    <h3> Summer in China 2017 </h3>
    <p> Hello World! So I spent about 2 months (9 weeks) in China last summer, and this blogpost is dedicated to sharing the wonderful experience I've had with my classmates and teachers in Harvard Beijing Academy (HBA). The immersive Chinese Language programme had about 90 participants in total, largely from Yale and Harvard, as well as a few other colleges like Williams and Pomona. At the start of HBA, we were all asked to sign the Chinese Language Pledge, to promise to only speak Chinese for the next 9 weeks, unless an emergency (e.g. requiring medical attention) arises. That, I feel, was one very effective way to force ourselves to improve our conversational Chinese skills. </p>
<br>
    <h4> Environment </h4>
      <p> Hot weather tbh. Plus air pollution. But there's cool winds too, and the occasional downpour that ruins your morning walk to school. </p>
<br>
    <h4> School life </h4>
      <p>      • 5 hours of class everyday | 8am-9:50am (Lectures with 8-10 students) | 10:10am-12pm (Drill class with 3-4 students) | 1:30pm-2:20pm OR 2:25pm - 3:15pm (One-on-One with the Teacher)
          <br> • 40-45 new Chinese words for Spelling test every morning
          <br> • 10 grammar structures for Drill class every day
          <br> • Written exam and Oral exam every Friday
          <br> • Chinese Table every Tues and Thurs (YAY free food!)
          <br> • Small Interest Group Outings (to Art districts, Shopping/Food streets, Tourist sites, etc) after exams every Friday! (Optional)
          <br> • Weekend Activities (climbing the Great Wall, visiting YiHeYuan, Chengde, watching an acrobatic performance, etc)
          <br> • 1 Week Social Studies Trip, midterm (Inner Mongolia, Shaolin Temple, Shanghai, Huizhou, Xi'an, etc)
          <br> • Random Chinese Cultural Activities (Chinese calligraphy, Chinese face painting, learning Wushu, playing Mahjong, making dumplings, singing Chinese songs, etc)
          <br> • Competitions (Speech comp, HBA T-shirt comp, Pronunciation comp, etc)
          <br> • Chinese Host Family (that might invite you to their house to eat/ bring you to visit cool places)

        </br>
        </p>
<br>
    <h4> Food </h4>
    <p> Really oily. Sometimes tongue-numbingly spicy. Quite difficult to find good Halal food. </p>

<br>
    <h4> Places to visit </h4>
    <p> So many!!! </p>

<br>
    <h4> People </h4>
    <p> Really friendly (: Especialy the students and teachers at the Beijing Language and Culture University. </p>
